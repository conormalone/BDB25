</B>Introduction</B>

A Quarterback’s target progression read refers to how he processes his in play passing options; usually as the play develops he will go through his available options as the situation rules out different choices in a straight progression: first choice –> second choice-> third choice -> fourth choice-> a checkdown; a Tight End or Running Back running a simple short route close to the line of scrimmage, available as a safety valve if none of the other options materialize. Usually this read progression depends on the context of the play design and isn’t know outside a teams offensive staff until a play has taken place.

This project explores the possibility of uncovering a quarterback's thought process: predicting their intended target before the play unfolds. By leveraging pre-snap data, it examines how the quarterback's decision-making evolves as additional insights into the defensive alignment emerge.
Applications

Potential applications of this method include:
Defence

    Predict where the opposition quarterback will be looking at different stages in the play.
    Be able to understand when the defence can probabilistically rule out certain receivers.
    Come up with schemes to direct these reads to say switch a qb off a star receiver without needing to double/triple teaming him.

Offence

    Better understand the QB mind under pressure and better design read progressions, perhaps in some cases a receiver is needlessly ruled out when they are in a better position than another.
    Identify inefficiencies in read design that might disadvantage the team, perhaps the read design sees an improbable first choice and vital split-seconds could be saved by putting that choice as a later option.

Broadcast

    In play projection of how likely a receiver is to be targeted.
    Post play metrics showing how an offensive or defensive change altered the read.
